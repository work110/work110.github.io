## Contributing

If you find any bugs you wish to contribute to, please fork and make a pull request.

Any additional features that I feel are not within the scope of this project, I will say they should fork and work independently. You can then upload to workshop as your own item. 

## Developing

There's a few ways you can test. Since this is intended for Wallpaper Engine:
    
  - Either download as zip or inside terminal, pick a location to clone to
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/teachtyler/Icosahedron-Geometry.git geometry
    ```
  - Inside wallpaper engine, choose a monitor, and click the Editor button at the top
  - Click, Create Wallpaper, and find directory where you downloaded/cloned the folder at
  - It should appear inside the Wallpaper Editor
  - Right click the thumbnail tile, `Open in Explorer`
    - Make changes to this folder, saving any changes made will be reloaded automatically in the Wallpaper Editor
    - Changes made in the original folder will not be reflected in the Wallpaper Editor 
    
    
 ####  To test project.json changes: 

  - Go to File -> Apply as Wallpaper
  - Inside Wallpaper UI, it should appear in your Installed section with the new Properties. This is also automatic.
